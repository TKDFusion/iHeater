Controls two iHeaters in tandem to achieve a target chamber temperatur, adding smart LED controls:
  LEFT: Fan status
  CENTER: Target temperature set
  RIGHT: Heater active (power >30%)

Based on the original single iHeater.cfg

I tested on my SV08 MAX. LED controls are not perfect, since the SV08 MAX doesn't have the latest version of Klipper so we cannot do duplicate_pin for correct heater / fan activity indicators.
I do a 2:1 weighted average for the two chamber thermistors, one in the designated hole on the back panel, the other moves around attached to the center of the gantry...
