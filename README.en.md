# About the iHeater Project

iHeater is a compact and powerful solution for creating an active thermal chamber in any 3D printer. It is especially essential for printers with closed or proprietary electronics, such as those from Creality, Bambu Lab, and FlashForge, where available ports or options for connecting heaters, fans, and thermistors are often limited.

iHeater connects via USB and takes over control independently of the mainboard's limitations. Depending on the firmware used, it can operate autonomously or with full integration into Klipper.

When used in combination with bed heating, iHeater ensures uniform chamber heating-a crucial factor for printing materials like ABS, PA, PC, and other engineering plastics. The device dynamically manages heating based on the air temperature, creating stable conditions inside the chamber without overheating or temperature spikes.

Two versions are currently available:

* 100W for smaller printers (archived)
* 200W for larger printers

**Under Klipper Control**

The board works as a separate MCU in Klipper, fully autonomously controlling the chamber heater and fan. Thanks to its 220 V power supply, iHeater does not load the printer’s power supply, which is especially important since stock PSUs often operate at their limit.

The cost of the board is comparable to or even lower than building a similar solution from a regular microcontroller, solid-state relay, and other components. Nevertheless, enthusiasts still have the option to build their own version.

iHeater is a simple way to add chamber heating to your printer to improve print quality and expand the range of materials used.

**With iHeater Firmware**

The iHeater board is self-sufficient and includes all the necessary peripherals and interface for use as a standalone device. The desired temperature is set by sequentially pressing the MODE button, and the selected temperature is encoded and displayed using three LEDs. The increment can be changed in the firmware.

```

4. Save and exit the menu.

5. Compile the firmware:

```bash
make clean
make
```

```ini
[include iHeater.cfg]
```

### 1. Connecting the iHeater MCU

Edit the `iHeater.cfg` file and specify the obtained serial ID:

```ini
[mcu iHeater]
serial: usb-Klipper_stm32f042x6_0C0018000D53304347373020-if000
```

## Usage

### Chamber Heating Commands

- Set chamber temperature:

```gcode
M141 S60 ; Set chamber temp to 60°C
```

- Wait for chamber to reach temperature:

```gcode
M191 S60 ; Wait until chamber reaches 60°C
```

- Stop chamber heating:

```gcode
M141 S0  ; Disable chamber heating
```

- At the end of your slicer’s G-code, add `M141 S0` to properly shut down chamber heating.

## Notes

- **Safety:**
  - Make sure all connections are correct and safe.
  - Check that min_temp and max_temp match your hardware specs.

- **Hardware check:**
  - Test heater and fan operation before use.
  - Monitor temperature during first runs.

- **PID tuning:**
  - Perform PID tuning if precise temperature control is needed. -->
